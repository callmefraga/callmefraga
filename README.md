### Hello, I’m João 👋🏼

I'm a Software Developer born in Brazil and raised in between 27 countries.

Graduating in Software Engineering at FIAP and already graduated from the Rocketseat bootcamp. In these bootcamp, I have dedicated myself to study: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, Bootstrap, Typescript, SQL, AWS and Git. Also, I like IOS Development. That's why now I'm learning Swift, SwiftUI and Xcode.
