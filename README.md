### Hello, I’m João 👋🏼

I'm a Software Developer born in Brazil and raised in between 27 countries.

I'm Graduating in Software Engineering at <a href="https://www.fiap.com.br/online/graduacao/bacharelado/engenharia-de-software/" target="_blank">FIAP</a> and already graduated from the <a href="https://www.rocketseat.com.br/" target="_blank">Rocketseat</a> Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. In these bootcamp, I have dedicated myself to study: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, Bootstrap, Typescript, SQL, AWS and Git. Also, I like IOS Development. That's why now I'm learning Swift, SwiftUI and Xcode.
